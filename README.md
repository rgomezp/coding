## coin_collector.py
Consider a n Ã— m board, where there is at most one coin per cell. A robot, located in the
upper left cell of the board, needs to collect as many of the coins as possible and bring them
to the bottom right cell. On each step, the robot can move either one cell to the right or
one cell down from its current location. When the robot visits a cell with a coin, it picks up
that coin.
Give an optimal dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum number of coins the
robot can collect. In your algorithmic description, you must include the recurrence equation
for your algorithm along with a description of the underlying subproblems that need to solved.
